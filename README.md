# Task 1: Third-Order Letter Approximation Model

### Overview
This project implements a third-order letter approximation model using five plain-text works from Project Gutenberg. 
The purpose of this model is to count the occurances of every three-character sequence in the cleaned text of these books.
The model can provide insights into frequency of specific letter sequences. 

### Functionality:
#### 1. load_and_clean_text(file_paths)
   - Loads mutiple text files, removes unwated characters, and converts all characters to uppercase.
   - Cleans the text by retaining only alphabetic characters, full stops, and spaces.
   - Paramater: file_paths - A list of file paths to the Project Gunteberg text files.
   - Returns: A cleaned string ready for trigram analysis.
  
#### 2. generate_tigrams(text)
   - Generates a trigram model by counting the occurances of every three-characters sequneces in the cleaned text.
   - Parameter: text - The cleaned string of text from which to extract trigrams.
   - Returns: A dictionary where the keys are trigrams and the values are their respective counts.
  
#### 3. display_top_trigrams(trigram_counts, n = 100)
   - Displays the top n most frequent trigrams from the trigram model.
   - Parameters:
     - trigram_counts - The dictionary of trigrams and their counts generated by generate_trigrams().
     - n - The number of top trigrams to display.
   - Displays: Displays the result directly.
